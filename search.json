    "text": "1:20 PM: Chicago Cubs\nThe Cubs are the league’s only regular daytime team. Wrigley Field did not install lights until 1988, and the franchise has kept early afternoon games as a defining feature. The schedule suits the team’s neighborhood setting and helps avoid late-night disruptions on Chicago’s North Side."

It is early enough for families and avoids late finishes on school nights, especially in smaller markets or in the Central and Mountain time zones. These teams tend to prioritize in-person attendance over prime-time television windows."

    "text": "6:38 PM: Los Angeles Angels\nThe Angels’ unusual 6:38 start time is intentional. The team shifted to non-round numbers years ago for broadcast visibility and to give fans more time to park and enter the stadium after Southern California rush hour. It is a local branding quirk that has become part of the routine."

Eastern and Southern teams often anchor here to align with nightly viewing habits. Later starts also help avoid early-evening heat in warmer climates like Texas and Georgia."

    "text": "7:07 PM: Toronto Blue Jays\nToronto’s 7:07 start time is one of MLB’s most recognizable quirks. The team has never formally explained it, but two theories persist:\nThe “double sevens” are often seen as a nod to 1977, the year the franchise was founded. Others point to the dual national anthems, “O Canada” and “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which add a few minutes of pregame ceremony compared with U.S. teams.\nWhatever the origin, the consistent 7:07 first pitch has become part of the Blue Jays’ brand identity and a subtle local signature in MLB scheduling.\n\nIn summary… go Sox\n\n View the code on GitHub"
